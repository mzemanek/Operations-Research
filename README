Deployment for Mono
 tested with Ubuntu Desktop Lucid (10.04)

Installing Mono:
sudo apt-get install mono-devel

Compile using a terminal:
./Development/Operations-Research.Mono.sh
 May require chmod 777 ./Development/Operations-Research.Mono.sh to make it executable.
 The bash file recreates ./Development/Release and runs gmcs with a response file (./Development/Source/Console.rsp).

Running the application:
mono ./Development/Release/OR.exe [...]
